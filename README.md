## Background
This repo consists of solutions for the tasks in [**FlexPower QuantChallenge**](https://github.com/FlexPwr/QuantChallenge). Below are simple descriptions of each task. 
* Task 1: Write two functions for compute buy and sell total volume each.
* Task 2: Write a function computing Profit and Loss for each strategy (PnL)
* Task 3: Expose the function written in task 2 as an entrypoint of a web application

Here, I mostly used Python packages [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) (task 1 & 2), [flask_restx](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (task 3). Therefore, installing these packages is a prerequisite.
